# Flutter_Learning_Path

A repo having day to day code of what I have learned.

## Audio Player

play audio from assets , internet

- ### TO improve:
  - assests audio doesn't supports pause,stop feature
  - Playing local files from storage is tricky
  - UI isn't good => provide a universal control feature for all the audios
  - avoid multiple audios to be played at a time
- ### Extras:
  - playing from phone storage
  - video player support (assets/local/url)
