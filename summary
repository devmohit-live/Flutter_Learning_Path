In this branch/day we will be modifying the day7 code so that:
* there will be no need to create a seperate file for every command
* will know how to pass and use multiple values in the url (GET method) that can be used as parameters for various commands like:
 - docker :  name, image, volume, etc
* displaying output for the commands.

passing two or more parameters:
ip/cgi-bin/file?a=val1&b=val2

TODO:

* Will have to learn controller and stateful widgets
* have to imporove the ui by :  automatically shifting the content upwards when keyboard apperas
